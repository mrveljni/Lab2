READ ME FOR FRONTEND.

Front End will contain the following files:
snake_search.html *** HTML query input site for user
snake_search.py *** front end code
snake5.jpg *** picture
background.jpg *** picture

Briefly how to run:

1. Terminal: run “python snake_search.py” to open and run the python file which runs the server
2. Click snake_search.html file: this will open the user input page where user searches their query

Please note: server is running the whole time while python sneak_search.py is running on terminal to localhost 8080.

Thanks!
